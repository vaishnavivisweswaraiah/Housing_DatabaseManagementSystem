# Housing_DatabaseManagementSystem

Current System:
The current system at most of the places around the country are either completely manual or semi-automated. The manual system starts all the way by calling the leasing office for availability and enquiring about the price and signing the lease, making payment and other manual process. This could be good for small housing company but for a company which has properties based in multiple locations this becomes tough, Also the manual process introduces lot of labor cost and window for potential errors. The semi-automated procedure also involves manual procedures but some things like payments are automated. 

Proposed Solution:
We are proposing a solution that maintains centralized database to store data about the companyâ€™s properties located in different places and total number of apartments under each house and details about properties that are already sold or available for sale, leased or vacant apartments. The system would store all the details about each and every property and minimize the manual efforts reducing the overcall costs. The system also contains the capability to receive and respond to complaints and intimating proper concerned department for appropriate solution. The system will also have the capability for the storing and retrieving historical data on demand.
